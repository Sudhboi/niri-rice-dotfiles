# Minimalistic OLED Centric Niri Rice (and other stuff)

This is my (gruvbox-adjacent) Niri rice with a focus on transparency and changing pixels to preserve OLED screens. Most of my configuration focuses on Translucent Widgets and turning off the screen, combined with a wallpaper that changes every two minutes.
