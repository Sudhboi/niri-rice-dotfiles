# Minimalistic OLED Centric Niri Rice (and other stuff)

This is my (gruvbox-adjacent) Niri rice with a focus on transparency and changing pixels to preserve OLED screens. Most of my configuration focuses on Translucent Widgets and turning off the screen, combined with a wallpaper that changes every two minutes.

## My Setup

| Tool | Application |
|:-----------:|:----:|
| Distro | Fedora Workstation 42 (update to 43 soon) |
| Window Manager | Niri |
| Status Bar | Waybar |
| Shell| zsh|
| Wallpaper Daemon | wpaperd|
